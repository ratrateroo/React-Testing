RTL Queries
    Quesries are the methods that Testing Library provides to find elements on the page
    
    To find a single element on the page, we have
        getBy..
        queryBy..
        findBy..

    To find multiple elements on the page, we have
        getAllBy..
        queryAllBy..
        findAllBy..

    The suffix can be one of Role, LabelText, PlaceHolderText, Text, DisplayValue, AltText, Title and finally TestId

    getBy.. queries

        getBy.. class of queries return the matching node of a query, and throw a descriptive error in no elements match or if more than one match is found

    1. getByRole
            getByRole queries form elements with the given role
                -Role refers toe the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application) role which provides semantic meaning to content to ensure people using assistive technologies are able to use them
            
            By default, many semantic elements in HTML have a role
                Button element has a buttun role, achor element has a link role, h1 to h6 elements have a heading role, checkboxes have a checkbox role, radio buttons have a radio role and so on.
            
            If you're working with elements that do not have a default role or if you want to specify a different role, the role attribute can be used to add the desired role.
            
            To use an achor element as a button in the navbar, you can add role='button'
    
    2. getByLabel
            example: const nameElement = screen.getByLabelText("Name", {selector:"input"})

    3. getByPlaceholderText
            example: const nameElement = screen.getByPlaceholderText("Fullname")
    4. getByText
            example: const nameElement = screen.getByText("Welcome Guest")
